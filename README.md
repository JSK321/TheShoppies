## Description
Shopify has branched out into movie award shows and we need your help. Please build us an app to help manage our movie nominations for the upcoming Shoppies.

## The Challenge
We need a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favourite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.

## Installation
NPM packages axios, material-ui/core, @material-ui/core, @material-ui/icons must be installed.

## Usage
Any user is able to nominate their movie of choice! They are able to search for movies using the search bar, which will bring up a result of movies. If the user clicks on the poster of the movie, a popup with more details about the movie will appear. A user is then able to nominate their movie of choice by clicking on the nominate button. It will then save the nominated movie into their list and disable the button, a user is able to remove their nomination by pressing the remove button. Once five movies have been nominated, a banner will show congratulating their vote for The Shoppies!
